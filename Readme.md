My projects I used to practise React

##React-Tutorial

Run the following to get the dependencies
`npm install`

and from the child folders run

`node server.js`

to get the program to run.

##React-Imgur
In order to run this you need an API key from Imgur and register your app.
After that you can add to the props of PictureGallery and open `index.html`.
